# sabily
Sabily, which means "my path" or "my way" in Arabic, is a project that provides a collection of Islamic tools designed for use by Muslims and Islamic educational institutions.    The name is inspired by the Quranic verse, "Say, 'This is my way...'" (Qul hādhihī sabīlī), and the project draws inspiration from "Sabily" – an Ubuntu Linux distribution previously developed by a Muslim team.
